* I'm a software developer based in Sydney, and I help development teams build maintainable and solid web and mobile apps.

* I've got a keen interest in **functional reactive programming**, **performance**, **scalable architectures** and **best practices**.

* I've got more than five years of corporate experience working in both small digital agencies and first-class international companies building responsive, mobile-first web applications with HTML5, CSS3 and JS.

* I'm also an **Android enthusiast** who enjoys building native apps for mobile devices.
