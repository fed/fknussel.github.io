# Personal Website

This is my personal website, blog and portfolio, just a simple site I built to showcase some of my work and write some ideas.

## Prerequisites

Install all of the dependencies you need by running `gem install github-pages` (or `sudo gem install -n /usr/local/bin/ github-pages` if the first one fails). This mirrors the GitHub Pages environment on your dev box including Jekyll and a bunch of plugins, Sass, etc.

## Building and Running

Serve the site and watch for markup/sass changes using `jekyll serve`. Your website will go live on http://localhost:4000. Commit any changes and push straight into master. GitHub Pages will automagically rebuild your site.
